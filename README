Multiple Choice Multidimensional Knapsack Proble.

An algorithm based on Lagrangean Relaxation and the Corridor Method is defined.
We solve both the deterministic version and the robust version. Some special
cases for the robust version are derived, depending on the structure of the
variance-covariance matrix.
